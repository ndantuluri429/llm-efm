Here, the LLMs were provided with precomputed, summarized time-series metrics rather than raw tracings. The models applied FIGO guideline criteria to these structured inputs to generate floating-point pH estimates. Performance was quantified using RMSE, MAE, bias, and $R^2$ against the ground truth
